## Introduction

This R markdown document describes the methodology and results of the data cleaning portion of the data analysis conducted for a reporting project examining the effects of climate-change driven temperature increases on the health of people who live in cities.  The project was done in partnership with the [University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/), [Capital News Service](https://cnsmaryland.org/), [the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/about-merrill/signature-programs/the-howard-center-for-investigative-journalism/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/), [Wide Angle Youth Media](https://www.wideanglemedia.org/) and [WMAR](https://www.wmar2news.com/). It also moved on the Associated Press wire.

### Definitions

**Geographic Units**: Several geographic units are used throughout the analysis. The geographic units are: 

* **U.S. Census block**: The smallest geographic area tracked by the U.S. Census bureau. Shapefiles downloaded from [Census.gov](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2018/TABBLOCK/).
* **ZCTAs - ZIP Code Tabulation Areas**: A U.S. Census proxy for postal ZIP Code units. Shapefiles downloaded from [Census.gov](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2018/ZCTA5/).
* **NSAs - Neighborhood Statistical Areas**: Areas created by Baltimore City to represent Baltimore neighborhoods, comprised of custom groupings of U.S. Census blocks. This grouping is considered by Baltimore City and this analysis as the best representation of true Baltimore neighborhoods. Shapefiles provided by the [Baltimore City Department of Planning](https://planning.baltimorecity.gov/maps-data/GIS).
* **CSAs - Community Statistical Areas**: Groupings of neighborhoods, created and used by the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA). In some cases, there is one neighborhood per CSA; in others, it's multiple. Recent demographic data is only available by CSA. Shapefiles downloaded from the [Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance Vital Signs project](https://data-bniajfi.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/794586676bcc4f5fb629c08c51474cf6_0).
* **Redlined geographic units**: Between 1935 and 1940, local real estate lenders, developers and real estate appraisers assigned grades to residential neighborhoods based on the perceived risk for banks to grant loans. This process was based in part on the race of residents and is known today as "redlining." The ["Mapping Inequality"](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=5/39.1/-94.58&text=intro) project, conducted by [teams at four different universities](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=12/39.293/-76.679&text=about), generated interactive maps of cities across the U.S., including Baltimore, and made their [shapefiles available by city](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/39.3/-76.673&text=downloads).

**A Note About ZCTAs**: 

* There are some slight differences in the exact boundaries between ZCTA shapefiles pulled from Census.gov when pulled county-by-county and for MD as a whole. All ZCTA groups are from the state-level ZCTA files.
* The Mid-Atlantic Terminal at Dundalk (sometimes included as part of the 21222 ZCTA) is not included.
* All calculations for included ZCTAs are done over the entire ZCTA, even when the ZCTA expands past the city boundary, with one exception. 21226 is cut off at the city boundary due to limitations the in treecover and heat maps. In addition, a small peninsula in that same ZCTA was removed for ease in computing.
* 4 ZCTAs ('21208', '21228', '21234', '21236') encroach slightly into Baltimore City, but were not included due to limitations in treecover and heat maps. 
* 3 included ZCTAs ('21227', '21222', '21237') only encroach slightly into Baltimore City but were included because the treecover and heat maps encompass them.
* An insignificant portion of the north end of 21237 is not included on the treecover map and is therefore missing from calculations made for that ZCTA.
* ZCTA lists for reference:
  * Complete list of Baltimore ZCTAs: '21201', '21202', '21205', '21206', '21207', '21208', '21209', '21210', '21211', '21212', '21213', '21214', '21215', '21216', '21217', '21218', '21222', '21223', '21224', '21225', '21226', '21227', '21228', '21229', '21230', '21231', '21234', '21236', '21237', '21239', '21251'
  * ZCTAs removed from list (for untrimmed): '21208', '21228', '21234', '21236'
  * Complete list of ZCTAs used (for untrimmed): '21201', '21202', '21205', '21206', '21207', '21209', '21210', '21211', '21212', '21213', '21214', '21215', '21216', '21217', '21218', '21222', '21223', '21224', '21225', '21226', '21227', '21229', '21230', '21231', '21237', '21239', '21251'

## Load and clean urban heat island temperature data

Researchers at Portland State University in Oregon and the Science Museum of Virginia provided temperature data from their Urban Heat Island Temperature study, which captured micro-level temperature variations for all of Baltimore City on August 29, 2018.

* The data can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/e63x9/).
* Full methodology paper [here](https://osf.io/ur7my/).

Temperature data was compiled in three batches for morning, afternoon and evening, in a raster image with one temperature value (in degrees celsius) per pixel.

For each time period, reporters used the open-source mapping program [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) to calculate zonal statistics (mean, median, min and max) for the temperature in several geographic units. 

After calculating the zonal statistics, reporters exported the files from QGIS as CSV files, loaded them into R and joined them into master tables for further processing and analysis.

### Define functions 
```{r}
# Convert celsius values to fahrenheit (could later replace with weathermetrics, which produces same values in multiple tests weathermetrics::celsius.to.fahrenheit())
c_to_f_convert <- function(x) (x * (9/5) + 32)

```

## Load and Clean Tree Canopy LIDAR Data

The U.S. Forest Service and the University of Vermont Spatial Analysis Lab Spatial Analysis Lab created detailed maps of Baltimore's tree canopy in 2007 and 2015 using LIDAR and aerial imagery data (Citation: O'Neil-Dunne J. 2017. GIS Shapefile, Tree Canopy Change 2007 - 2015 - Baltimore City. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/79c1d2079271546e61823a98df2d2039).

The original shapefile data was presented in terms of "no change," "gain," and "loss" categories. To perform the following analysis, we restructured the data within QGIS to represent 2007 and 2015 canopy coverage and calculated zonal statistics (mean and median) at each year. They then exported the data from QGIS into CSVs, loaded them into R and joined them into master tables for further processing and analysis.

## Load and Clean Demographic Data

The only recent demographic data available for neighborhood proxy areas is from the [Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance](https://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/data_downloads/), a **CSA-level** analysis from 2017. The U.S. federal government has not collected demographic information at many micro-geographic levels with reasonable margins of error since the 2010 Census, which this analysis determined is generally too old to be useful. The exception to this is the annual [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/2017/), which we used at a **ZCTA-level** geographic grouping. Additionally, this analysis used the 2010 population numbers at the **block** level to filter out low-population blocks. This portion of the analysis did not use demographic information at the **NSA** level, because the data did not exist in a readily available format with reasonable error margins.

### Execute load-in and cleaning
```{r}

# Common file path to raw demographics data
folder <- "demographics/"

#### Blocks #### 
# Read in 2010 population data, SF1 U.S. Census data by block. Used only to filter out no population blocks before doing analysis. Otherwise, 2010 data is too old to use.
demographics_block <- read_csv(paste0(path_to_data, folder, "by_block/2010_SF1_Baltimore_City_Population_by_Block.csv")) %>%
  rename_all(tolower) %>%
  mutate("geoid10" = as.character(geoid10))

#### CSA #### 
# Data from BNIA, reading in 2017 values. https://bniajfi.org/vital_signs/data_downloads/.  
# Clean column names and remove citywide values for Baltimore City so it joins correctly.

  clean_names() %>%
  rename_all(tolower) %>%
  filter(csa2010 != "Baltimore City")

#### NSA #### 
# No available demographic data, because these are shapefiles constructed by the city from census blocks, not an actual U.S. Census product.  Block groups and tracts stretch across the boundaries. Therefore, the only available valid data is from the 2010 Census.

#### ZCTA #### 
# From American Community Survey, 5 year averages 2017.
demographics_zcta <- read_csv(paste0(path_to_data, folder, "by_zcta/acs_2017_baltimore_zctas.csv")) %>%
  rename_all(tolower) %>%
  filter(zcta != "CITYWIDE")
```

## Combine Data for Each Geographic Area

Once the individual component data frames have been created and cleaned, they can be merged and saved for use in the analysis.

```{r}
#### Blocks #### 
# Demographics at this level only used for removing low population blocks
blocks_tree_temp_population <- all_temp_block %>%

# Merge check:  All three files have 13598 records, as does the merged file

#### CSA ####
csa_tree_temp_demographics <- all_temp_csa %>%
  left_join(tree_csa_lidar_2007_2015) %>%
  left_join(demographics_csa) %>%

  mutate_at(vars(csa2010), tolower)
# Merge check: All three files have 55 records, as does joined file

nsa_tree_temp <- all_temp_nsa %>%
  left_join(tree_nsa_lidar_2007_2015, by=c('nsa_name' = 'label')) %>%

  mutate(lid_change_percent = ifelse(is.infinite(lid_change_percent) | is.nan(lid_change_percent), NA, lid_change_percent)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(nsa_name), tolower)
# Merge check: the difference in the number of records between the temperature data frame (279) and the tree data frame (278) is because temp has an extra record for Unnamed areas, because of slight differences between the extent of the temperature raster and the NSA shapefile. Here, we drop the unnamed column on join.

#### ZCTA ####
zcta_temp_demographics <- all_temp_zcta %>%
  right_join(demographics_zcta, by=c('zcta5ce10' = 'zcta')) %>%
  rename_all(tolower) %>%
  rename(zcta = 'zcta5ce10') %>%
  select(-"geoid10", -"classfp10", -"mtfcc10", -"funcstat10")
# Merge check: All tables have 55 records

#### Remove unneeded files ####
rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("blocks_tree_temp_population", "zcta_temp_demographics", "nsa_tree_temp", "csa_tree_temp_demographics", "path_to_data")))

```

## Load and Clean Individual Tree Data

Baltimore's urban forestry division tracks each tree and potential tree site across the city and provided this analysis with a database of those records and [accompanying documentation](street-tree-inventory-spec-sheet.pdf). 

The raw data arrived as a .shp file, which reporters joined together with the various core geographies and exported as a CSV for processing in R. The analysis focused on NSA-level geographies.

### Define functions and store universal variables

```{r}

# List of NSAs of interest for our analysis
target_nsas <- c("Berea", "Broadway East", "Oliver", "Middle East", "Biddle Street","Milton-Montford", "Madison-Eastend", "CARE", "McElderry Park", "Ellwood Park/Monument", "Patterson Place", "Patterson Park Neighborhood", "Baltimore Highlands", "Highlandtown", "Upper Fells Point") %>%
  lapply(tolower)

# List of nearby NSAs of interest for our analysis
counterpoint_nsas <- c("Butcher's Hill", "Canton", "Washington Hill") %>%
  lapply(tolower)

# Common file path to raw demographics data
folder <- "street-trees/csv/"

```

## Load and Clean Hourly Temperature Data at BWI and Inner Harbor (DMH)
We acquired historical temperature data for National Weather Service monitoring stations at both BWI airport (BWI) and the Inner Harbor monitoring station (DMH) and used it in various parts of our analysis.  We got this data from the [Iowa State University Iowa Environmental Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), which contains information for [global ASOS monitoring stations](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/request/download.phtml). We captured temperature, humidity and dew point data, which we used to calculate heat index.

# We have 75 years of dew point and temperature data for BWI, which allows us to calculate heat index
# We have 20 years of dew point and temperature data for DMH (Inner Harbor), which allows us to calculate heat index. 
# Dan Li, a climate researcher at Boston University who has studied variation in urban heat island temperatures between suburbs in different seasons and different hours of the day, said a pretty good way to calculate the difference in urban v suburban heat island, and create a longer estimated historical record of temperatures at DMH would be:

# Join the 20 years of DMH data to the 20 years of BWI data.  Join on date and hour, so we end up with a data frame of values for both DMH and BWI for each date and hour in our data set.  Do an inner join, so that if for some reason DMH is missing an hour from its data set (or vice versa), it doesn't mess up our averages. Calculate new columns with difference in temperature, dew point, relative humidity and heat index between BWI and DMH.  Since in almost all cases BWI will be colder than DMH, make it so the difference is positive if DMH is greater than BWI.

## Adjust for Urban Heat Island and Calculate Adjusted Heat Index
# For each call, we now have the temperature and heat index value as recorded at the Inner Harbor station at the date and time of the call.  But we have not yet accounted for the fact that, in Baltimore City, temperatures can vary greatly between the Inner Harbor and other parts of the city.  We obtained urban heat island raster images, showing block-by-block temperature variations in Baltimore calculated using mobile temperature sensors and satellite data on August 29, 2018. (Citation: Shandas, V.; Voelkel, J.; Williams, J.; Hoffman, J. Integrating Satellite and Ground Measurements for Predicting Locations of Extreme Urban Heat. Climate 2019, 7, 5.  https://osf.io/e63x9/) and processed them in QGIS to obtain median afternoon temperatures for each ZIP code in our analysis.  We then adjusted each call's Inner Harbor temperature to account for the delta between the Inner Harbor monitoring station's ZIP code (21230) temperature in the urban heat island study and each call's ZIP code temperature in the urban heat island study.  Using the adjusted temperature, we recalculated the heat index using the dew point reading captured at the Inner Harbor.

## Create Heat Index Buckets

#In order to examine the impact of extreme temperatures on EMS calls, we need to assign each call's adjusted heat index value to one of four temperature buckets we've created to align with the National Weather Service's heat index safety threshold table. https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index. 

#The NWS heat index formula assumes conditions of light wind and shade, noting that exposure to full sun can increase heat index values by up to 15 degrees. We didn't feel comfortable adjusting heat index values to account for this, so this is where we are.  We were also unable to obtain the necessary data to calculate "wet bulb globe temperature", which the NWS says can be a better measure of heat stress in full sunlight. 

#The NWS heat index buckets are:
#* < 80 = not unsafe temperatures for heat
#* 80-89 = caution
#* 90-102 = extreme caution
#* 103-124 = danger
#* Approximately 125+ = extreme danger

## Load and clean sensor data

We built temperature and humidity sensors, using this ["Harlem Heat" project guide](https://github.com/datanews/harlem-heat) created by WNYC public radio for their [Harlem Heat Project](https://www.wnyc.org/series/harlem-heat-project). We placed them in several homes in Baltimore in summer 2019 and joined them with outdoor temperature to examine how heat index varied indoors and out.

## Load and Clean Historical Baltimore and U.S. Weather Data 
To calculate how average annual temperatures in Baltimore changed compared to the U.S. over the last century, we pulled data from NOAA's National Climatic [Data Center](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access) on [average annual temperatures](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/county/time-series) for both geographies.

## Increase in Hot Days Data
To examine how climate change will drive up the number of extreme heat index days in the future, we used data from researchers at the Union of Concerned Scientists and the University of Idaho, described in the research paper: ["Increased frequency of and population exposure to extreme heat index days in the United States during the 21st century"](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2019/07/killer-heat-environmental-research-communications-article.pdf). [The data we used is available here](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/global-warming-impacts/killer-heat-in-united-states).
