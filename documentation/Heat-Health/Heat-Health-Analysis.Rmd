## Line-By-Line Fact-Check

### Fact: 96 Degrees in Michael Thomas and Alberta Wilkerson's Apartment [cq]
"As the temperature in their rowhouse apartment rose to a humid 96 degrees F during a summer heat wave, Michael Thomas and Alberta Wilkerson sat on their bed, in front of fans, wiping sweat and drinking water, trying to keep their minds off the heat."

#### Explanation [cq]
A reporter spent time with Michael Thomas and Alberta Wilkerson in the afternoon of July 20, 2019, and observed this scene.  On July 20, 2019, the average temperature between 4 and 5 p.m. in their home was 96.0 degrees, with a heat index of 109.2, according to sensors placed in the home.

```

### Fact: July 2019 Heat Wave [cq]
"The couple decided to stay in their unairconditioned, second-floor home in Broadway East in East Baltimore during the scorching 11-day stretch in July. It was a risky decision. The heat wave included two days when outdoor temperatures hit 100 degrees and sparked a Code Red heat emergency, which city officials declare when the temperature reaches dangerous levels."

#### Explanation [cq]
July 12-22 had maximum temperatures at the NWS's Inner Harbor weather station of at least 90 degrees F and max heat indexes of at least 92 F, found using hourly snapshot data. The table below shows on only one day was there an hourly average of 100 degrees, July 21.  Using a different dataset from the NCDC, the official maximum for each day, which is calculated using minute-by-minute readings, shows it as 100 on July 20 and 101 on July 21.

### Fact: Heat Index in Michael Thomas and Alberta Wilkerson's Apartment [cq]
"At 10:30 p.m. on July 18, the heat index in their living quarters reached a high of 116 degrees, according to a sensor they allowed reporters from the University of Maryland’s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and Capital News Service to place in their home for several weeks. That was 22 degrees hotter than the heat index outdoors."

#### Explanation [cq]
At 10:30 p.m. inside their apartment on July 18, the temperature was 94.5 degrees, but the humidity inside pushed the heat index to 116 degrees. The heat index at the time at the NWS' Inner Harbor monitoring station was 94 degrees.  It was 22 degrees hotter inside their apartment than it was at the Inner Harbor, using the heat index as a metric.

### Fact: EMS calls for certain conditions spike when it gets very hot [cq]
"That helps explain why, during the summer in Baltimore, emergency medical calls for dehydration, respiratory distress, kidney disease, diabetes complications, heart attacks and heart failure spiked when the heat index rose above 103 degrees, according to a Howard Center data analysis."

#### Explanation [cq]
Using emergency medical call records from Baltimore City, we examined calls during Summer 2018.  They were aligned to heat index data captured at the Inner Harbor at the time of each call and adjusted for the urban heat island using the ZIP code of each call location.  The statistics in the table below represent the number of hours that passed between calls for select conditions when the temperature was in a given heat index bucket. 

For example, in Summer 2018, when the heat index was under 80 degrees, there was a medical call for dehydration every 41 hours.  When the heat index hit 103 degrees, the rate of calls increased dramatically -- to one every 2.2 hours. The table below shows the difference in calls per hour at different temperature groupings. 

#### Supporting code and output  [cq]

### Fact: Morning temperature on July 19 [cq]
"It was the morning of July 19, and the outdoor temperature would rise to 98 degrees."

#### Explanation [cq]
July 19 was particularly hot in Baltimore. By 2 p.m., the temperature at the Inner Harbor hit 98.1 degrees, using hourly averages, the hottest it would get all day.   

#### Supporting code and output [cq]

```

### Fact: Extreme heat in Audrey DeWitt's House [cq]
"Despite the units, a sensor placed on the first floor by University of Maryland journalists recorded a heat index of 92 degrees at 6 a.m. on July 20. That was two degrees hotter than the heat index outdoors."

#### Explanation [cq]
Air conditioning window units, not uncommon in our reporting, often weren't enough to combat the heat.  In Audrey DeWitt's home, the heat index hit 91.8 degrees at 6 a.m. on July 20. The outdoor heat index was 90 degrees at the time.

```

### Fact: Data for graphic on temperature and health conditions [cq]
"In Baltimore, the urban heat island effect means some parts of the city are hotter than others. And in the hottest parts of the city, it’s an unfortunate truth that low-income people have higher rates of chronic health conditions affected by heat, when compared with low-income people who live in cooler parts of the city, a Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and Capital News Service analysis found.

The first (left) map shows afternoon temperature variations by ZIP code in August 2018, as measured by climate researchers. The right (second) map shows the prevalence of selected health conditions among Medicaid patients who were admitted to the hospital between 2013 and 2018."

#### Explanation [cq]
We examined rates of chronic conditions among low-income people in different parts of Baltimore by examining in-patient hospital admissions by people on Medicaid in Baltimore, and discovered that low-income people in different parts of the city had different diagnosis rates for chronic conditions affected by heat -- asthma, COPD, heart disease, kidney disease and diabetes. And, we found, those differences varied in line with temperature differences in the area in which they lived.

There were moderate to strong positive relationships (kidney disease, r = .6; copd, r=.75; asthma, r=.51; heart_disease, r=.71; diabetes, r=.5) between a ZIP code's prevelence rate for chronic medical conditions as diagnosed in inpatient hospital visits and a ZIP code's median afternoon temperature as measured by urban heat island researchers in August 2018.  That is to say: the higher the neighborhood temperature, the higher the disease rate among the poorest inhabitants, and vice versa. This is not a causal relationship we are describing.  

We've also output the table for the graphic here.

#### Supporting code and output [cq]

    filter(str_detect(rowname, "asthma|copd|kidney|heart_disease|diabetes")) %>%

    select(matches("ZIPCODE|asthma|copd|kidney|heart_disease|diabetes|temp"))%>%
    select(ZIPCODE, temp_median_aft, everything()) %>%
    arrange(ZIPCODE)
    

```


### Fact: Asthma rates in Baltimore [cq]
"Asthma rates in low-income areas like McElderry Park and Broadway East are higher than in more affluent areas."

#### Explanation [cq]
There is a high degree of correlation between a geographic population's asthma prevelence rate in Baltimore, and that populations level of affluence.  Using detailed records of hospital admissions and emergency room visits, we determined the percentage of patients from each ZIP code who had an asthma diagnosis, and compared it to that ZIP code's poverty rate and median household income from U.S. Census data.  There was a strong positive relationship (r = .74) between a ZIP code's emergency room asthma rate and the percentage of people below the poverty line; the higher the asthma rate, the higher the poverty rate, and vice versa.  There was a strong negative relationship (r = -.71) between a ZIP code's asthma rate and the median household income; the lower the median household income, the higher the asthma rate, and vice versa. This is not a causal relationship we are describing here.  It's just that, in Baltimore, rich neighborhoods tend to have lower prevelence of asthma, compared with poorer ones.  

McElderry Park is mostly contained in 21205 and Broadway East is mostly in 21213.  21205 had the third highest asthma rate (12.6 percent) in the city and the second highest poverty rate (37.13), 21213 had the second highest asthma rate (13.2 percent) and the sixth-highest poverty rate (28.2 percent).  ZIP code 21209, in a much wealthier part of town, had the city's lowest poverty rate (7.7 percent) and the city's second lowest asthma prevelence (4.8 percent).

### Fact: Baltimore's hottest neighborhood [cq]
"..McElderry Park, Baltimore’s hottest neighborhood, has three young sons with the disease." 

#### Explanation [cq]

### Fact: Extreme heat in Stephanie Pingley's house [cq]
"Pingley says that room can get as “hot as Hades,” which is reflected in readings of a sensor placed there. The heat index in that room climbed as high as 118 degrees and never dropped below 88 degrees over a seven-day stretch."

#### Explanation [ca]
The sensor readings taken inside of Stephanie Pingley's home reflect the extreme heat her family experienced.  The minimum indoor heat index value between July 16 and July 22 was 88 degrees, and the max was 118.  These values reflect minute by minute readings.

### Fact: EMS calls for psychiatric/drug disorders [cq]
"In Baltimore, the rate of emergency medical calls for psychiatric disorders and drug and alcohol overdoses increased dramatically when the heat index hit 103 degrees, the Howard Center data analysis found."

#### Explanation [cq]
Using emergency medical call records from Baltimore City, we examined calls during Summer 2018.  They were aligned to heat index data captured at the Inner Harbor and adjusted for the urban heat island using the ZIP Code of each call location.  The statistics in the table below represent the number of hours that passed between calls for select conditions when the temperature was in a given heat index bucket. 

For example, in Summer 2018, when the heat index was under 80 degrees, there was a medical call for a behavioral and psychiatric disorder every 1.77 hours (1 hour, 46 minutes). When the heat index hit 103 degrees, the rate of calls increased dramatically -- to one call every 1.29 hours (1 hour, 17 minutes). The increase for drug and alcohol (ETOH) related calls was even sharper in extreme heat, as the table below shows.  For example, drug overdoses happened at a rate of one call every 2.24 hours when it was under 80, but increased to about one call per hour over 103.
